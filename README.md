# Feedback Management Platform

## Project description
Feedback Management Platform is a solution that helps companies to manage, organize and deliver feedback to their employees. 

The project has as scope to demonstrate how an organization can make use of features from the Microsoft Identity Platform in order to improve the existing processes in order to become more productive and transparent with the employees.

Based on the Microsoft Identity Platform, the application uses the MSLA to authenticate based on the userâ€™s credentials, the Microsoft Graph to get data regarding employees,  and gives to the employee the opportunity to create and send feedback to his colleagues. In the case of a manager, he can see and analyze the feedback for his team.
